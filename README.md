This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, bug in Python: silent failure when calculating the average of a list that contains non-numeric elements.  The `bug.py` file showcases the flawed function. The `bugSolution.py` provides a robust solution that gracefully handles both empty lists and lists with non-numeric elements, preventing unexpected behavior and runtime errors. This example highlights the importance of defensive programming and robust error handling to avoid unexpected application crashes or incorrect results.
